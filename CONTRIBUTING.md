## How to contribute

If you are reading this you probably want to contribute, so thanks! Maintaining an open-source project is hard work and any help is welcome.

### Reporting a bug

If you find a bug, before reporting it, check if it's not [already reported][issues].  

If you're the first one to report it, please, follow those recommendations: 
- Write a clear and precise title
- Write a description which contain a scenario on how to reproduce the bug. Feel free to post a link to [Plunker][plunker]
- You'll never be too precise so don't hesitate to give more informations: OS, browser, node version...

### Writing a pull request

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don't you'll probably just be asked to anyway.**

Fork the [hm-admin][hm-admin] project and work on your own fork.  
You have to work on a branch with a clear name (feature/writing-how-to-contribute for example). Prefixing your branch by 
"feature/" (for new feature) and "hotfix/" (for issue resolving) is a good practice.

When your work is done:
 
- Rebase your branch on the current master
- Be sure that all tests pass, your code is lint free and the code coverage is still higher than 90%. You can run `ng test` to check
- Squash your commits to one commit and follow those recommendations about [writing good commit message][writing-good-commit-message]
- Build a pull request via github from your yourFork/yourBranch to the hm-admin/master branch
 
### Write some Tests

Don't forget to write tests about your component. I'm sure that your work is pretty awesome, but writing tests could help 
to avoid regression in the future.  
Follow recommendations about [writing test in angular2][writing-test].  
When your tests pass and only after that, you can [propose a pull request][pr]


### Set up your development environment

#### docker development environment

Please note that using docker is not mandatory, feel free to develop with your local environment.

To quickly start hacking, hm-admin comes with a docker ready development environment.

It leverages three services:

- `hm-admin`: The interesting part in our case. Hm-admin is running in this container and hm-admin sources are shared with the host
- `api` and `mysql`: Those containers are responsible for the API to be developed and tested against. The API is made from https://api-platform.com/.

##### Initial steps for setting up your docker development environment

Install node dependencies

```
docker-compose run hm-admin npm install
```

Your environment should be now ready to run

##### Launch docker development environment

```
docker-compose up
```

Now, your hm-admin should be accessible at http://dockerhost:4200 (where `dockerhost` is the docker host in your local setup. It could be `localhost`, `docker.local`, `dockerhost`, I donâ€™t know but you should ;) ).

The API part should be accessible at http://dockerhost:60000, you may want to see the API doc at http://dockerhost:60000/doc.

##### troubleshotting

If API is never available at http://dockerhost:60000, you may want to change the logging driver of services `mysql` and `api` from `none` to `json-file`. Then restart `docker-compose up` and analyse the output of mysql and the API.
